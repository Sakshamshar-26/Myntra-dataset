# Myntra Data Analysis using Excel  

This project demonstrates how a Myntra dataset was analyzed using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on turning raw, unstructured data into actionable insights.  

## Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant records  
- Handled missing values  
- Standardized formats using Excel functions (conditional formatting, text functions, logical formulas)  

## Data Analysis  
- Created **Pivot Tables** to summarize product categories, pricing, and customer segments  
- Added **Slicers** for interactive filtering and exploration  
- Built an Excel file that functions like a simple dashboard  

## Key Insights  
- Identified best-selling categories  
- Evaluated pricing effectiveness  
- Analyzed overall sales distribution patterns  

## Tools and Skills Used  
- Excel Functions (data cleaning and transformation)  
- Pivot Tables (summarization and trend analysis)  
- Slicers (interactive filtering)  
- Data Preparation and Visualization  

## Conclusion  
This project highlights my ability to handle an end-to-end analysis pipeline: starting with raw data, cleaning it for accuracy, and generating interactive insights using Excel.  

The repository includes the cleaned dataset and the Excel workbook with applied functions, Pivot Tables, and Slicers.
